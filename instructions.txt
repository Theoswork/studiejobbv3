Instructions for My Development Project
About Me: I am a beginner developer, so please keep the explanations simple and easy to follow. Avoid overcomplicating the code or concepts.

Project Overview: I am building a job-hunting site called Studiejobb.se, which is unique because:

No Personal or IQ Tests: Users applying for jobs will not need to complete personal or IQ tests.
Freelancing Options: The site will allow users to freelance by:
Offering services like reviewing CVs.
Helping with marketing tasks for the site.
Technical Setup:

I am using Visual Studio Code (VSC) and hosting with Firebase.
The project uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Firebase for features like Authentication and Realtime Database.
Development Style:

Keep It Simple: Focus on clear, beginner-friendly solutions.
Code Modularity: Use separate .js files for scripts like authentication, page-specific logic, and configuration.
Redirect and Feedback: Provide user feedback (like messages) and ensure logical navigation between pages.
Responsive Design: The pages should be functional on both desktop and mobile devices, but I’m okay with basic layouts for now.
Current Features:

User signup and login (working with Firebase Authentication).
A “Mitt Konto” page where users can view account details and log out.
Future Goals:

Allow users to create job listings and apply for jobs.
Support freelancing features, like offering CV reviews or marketing services.
Provide an admin dashboard for managing job postings.
What I Expect:

Clear, step-by-step guidance.
Explanations of any new features or techniques.
Code that I can copy, paste, and test in my project.
Thank you for helping me build this project!

Important Notes from Chat:

1. **Firebase Integration:**
   - Firebase Authentication and Firestore are set up for your job-hunting site.
   - Users can create accounts, log in, save job ads, and view saved/applied jobs on their account page.

2. **Database Structure:**
   - Jobs are stored in a "jobs" collection with fields: `title`, `company`, `location`.
   - User-specific data is stored in a "users" collection. Each document uses the user's `uid` as its ID and includes:
       - `preferences`: User's preferred job type and location.
       - `jobs`: Includes arrays `saved` and `applied`.

3. **Implemented Features:**
   - **Index Page (index.html):**
     - Displays jobs fetched dynamically from Firestore.
     - Includes a "Save Job" button for each job ad, which saves the job to the logged-in user's Firestore document.
   - **Mitt Konto Page (mittkonto.html):**
     - Displays saved jobs, applied jobs, and user preferences.
     - Allows users to update their preferences and log out.

4. **Key Firebase Functions:**
   - **Firestore Fetch:**
     - Fetches job ads using `getDocs(collection(db, "jobs"))`.
   - **Save Job:**
     - Adds a job to the `jobs.saved` array in the logged-in user's Firestore document.
   - **Authentication:**
     - Ensures users are logged in before performing actions like saving jobs.

5. **Testing Steps:**
   - Add job ads via `publicerajobb.html`.
   - Verify jobs are displayed on the `index.html`.
   - Log in and save jobs; verify they appear in the user's Firestore document.
   - View saved jobs on `mittkonto.html`.

6. **Files Created/Modified:**
   - `index.html`: Added Save Job functionality and layout for filters, job list, and login.
   - `index.js`: Handles fetching job ads, rendering them, and saving jobs.
   - `mittkonto.js`: Manages user account features, such as displaying saved/applied jobs and updating preferences.
   - Firebase configuration is stored in `firebaseConfig.js`.

7. **Next Steps:**
   - Test and refine the current implementation.
   - Add more functionality as needed, such as job search filters or job application tracking.
