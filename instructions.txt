Instructions for My Development Project
About Me: I am a beginner developer, so please keep the explanations simple and easy to follow. Avoid overcomplicating the code or concepts.

Project Overview: I am building a job-hunting site called Studiejobb.se, which is unique because:

No Personal or IQ Tests: Users applying for jobs will not need to complete personal or IQ tests.
Freelancing Options: The site will allow users to freelance by:
Offering services like reviewing CVs.
Helping with marketing tasks for the site.
Technical Setup:

I am using Visual Studio Code (VSC) and hosting with Firebase.
The project uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Firebase for features like Authentication and Realtime Database.
Development Style:

Keep It Simple: Focus on clear, beginner-friendly solutions.
Code Modularity: Use separate .js files for scripts like authentication, page-specific logic, and configuration.
Redirect and Feedback: Provide user feedback (like messages) and ensure logical navigation between pages.
Responsive Design: The pages should be functional on both desktop and mobile devices, but I’m okay with basic layouts for now.
Current Features:

User signup and login (working with Firebase Authentication).
A “Mitt Konto” page where users can view account details and log out.
Future Goals:

Allow users to create job listings and apply for jobs.
Support freelancing features, like offering CV reviews or marketing services.
Provide an admin dashboard for managing job postings.
What I Expect:

Clear, step-by-step guidance.
Explanations of any new features or techniques.
Code that I can copy, paste, and test in my project.
Thank you for helping me build this project!
